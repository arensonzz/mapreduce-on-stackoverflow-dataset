124,26,2008-08-01T16:09:47Z,80,12,wound using this kind hack but actually works pretty well the only thing you have very careful with your semicolons var strsqlstring var inumber var strsqlsplitarray strsqlsplit for strsqlsplitlength
199,50,2008-08-01T19:36:46Z,180,1,ive read somewhere the human eye cant distinguish between less than values apart this something keep mind the following algorithm does not compensate for this not sure this exactly what you want but this one way randomly generate nonrepeating color values beware inconsistent pseudocode ahead colors entered bcolors holds final colors usedrand new randomassumes less than randomgenint while lencolors generate random number between for each color newred randnext newgreen randnext newblue randnext temp newred newgreen newblue only adds new colors the array temp not colors colorsappendtemp one way you could optimize this for better visibility would compare the distance between each new color and all the colors the array for item color itemsq item item item tempsq temp temp temp dist itemsq tempsq dist absdistnumber can your chosen distance apartif dist number and temp not colors colorsappendtemp but this approach would significantly slow down your algorithm another way would scrap the randomness and systematically through every values and add color array the above example
269,91,2008-08-01T23:49:57Z,260,4,yes thought about that but soon figured out that another domainspecificlanguage dsl would bit too much essentially they need interact with gamestate possibly unpredictable ways for example card could have rule when this cards enter play all your undead minions gain attack against flying enemies except when the enemy blessed trading card games are turn based the gamestate manager will fire onstagex events and let the cards modify other cards the gamestate whatever way the card needs try create dsl have implement rather large feature set and possibly constantly update which shifts the maintenance work another part without actually removing thats why wanted stay with real net language essentially able just fire the event and let the card manipulate the gamestate whatever way within the limits the code access security
307,49,2008-08-02T01:49:46Z,260,28,really great introduction providing script abilities your application different approach would consider language that specifically built for scripting such href href href ironpython and ironruby are both available today for guide embedding ironpython read lua scripting language commonly used games there lua compiler for net available from codeplex href that codebase great read you want learn about building compiler net different angle altogether try href there are numerous examples embedding powershell into application heres thorough project the topic
332,59,2008-08-02T03:00:24Z,330,19,would bit reluctant use nested classes here what you created abstract base class for multimedia driver handle the backend stuff workhorse and separate class for the frontend work the frontend class could take pointerreference implemented driver class for the appropriate media type and situation and perform the abstract operations the workhorse structure philosophy would ahead and make both structures accessible the client polished way just under the assumption they would used tandem would reference something like
344,100,2008-08-02T04:18:15Z,260,6,you might able use ironruby for that otherwise suggest you have directory where you place precompiled assemblies then you could have reference the the assembly and class and use reflection load the proper assemblies runtime you really want compile runtime you could use the codedom then you could use reflection load the dynamic assembly
359,119,2008-08-02T06:16:23Z,260,5,you could use any the dlr languages which provide way really easily host your own scripting platform however you dont have use scripting language for this you could use and compile with the code provider long you load its own appdomain you can load and unload your hearts content
473,49,2008-08-02T15:33:13Z,470,8,what youre doing fine dont let those people confuse you youve written the web services with net then the reference proxies generated net are going quite suitable the situation you describe where you are both producer and consumer the ideal situation you need connect web services that unknown compile time then you would want more dynamic approach where you deduce the shape the web service but start using the auto generated proxy class and dont worry about until you hit limitation and when you come back stack overflow
529,86,2008-08-02T18:16:07Z,180,3,isnt also factor which order you set the colors like you use dillieos idea you need mix the colors much possible from one the next but wheel would more apart does this make sense
539,157,2008-08-02T19:03:52Z,180,21,first thought this how generate vectors space that maximize distance from each other you can see that the rgb any other scale you use that forms basis color space are just vectors take look hope this good start for you once you have set vectors that are maximized part you can save them hash table something for later and just perform random rotations them get all the colors you desire that are maximally apart from each other edit thinking about this problem more would better map the colors linear manor possibly lexicographically and then distribute them evenly really dont know how well this will work but should since lets say know have colors can use find the lexicographically indexed color youll probably have edit the algorithm avoid overflow and probably add some minor speed improvements
585,149,2008-08-02T23:40:04Z,580,13,for projects alternate between sql compare from red gate and the database publishing wizard from microsoft which you can download free href the wizard isnt slick sql compare sql data compare but does the trick one issue that the scripts generates may need some rearranging andor editing flow one shot the side can move your schema and data which isnt bad for free tool
586,34,2008-08-02T23:51:09Z,580,17,ive taken handcoding all ddl createsalterdelete statements adding them sln text files and using normal versioning using subversion but any revision control should work this way not only get the benefit versioning but updating live from devstage the same process for code and database tags branches and work all the same otherwise agree redgate expensive you dont have company buying for you you can get company buy for you though really worth
590,116,2008-08-03T00:22:03Z,580,2,you have company buying toad from quest software has this kind management functionality built its basically twoclick operation compare two schemas and generate sync script from one the other they have editions for most the popular databases including course sql server
591,111,2008-08-03T00:37:03Z,580,3,work the same way karl does keeping all sql scripts for creating and altering tables text file that keep source control fact avoid the problem having have script examine the live database determine what alters run usually work like this the first version place everything during testing into one sql script and treat all tables create this means end dropping and readding tables lot during testing but thats not big deal early into the project since usually hacking the data using that point anyway all subsequent versions two things make new text file hold the upgrade sql scripts that contain just the alters for that version and make the changes the original create fresh database script well this way upgrade just runs the upgrade script but have recreate the dont need run scripts get there depending how deploying the changes ill also usually put version table the that holds the version the then rather than make any human decisions about which scripts run whatever code have running the createupgrade scripts uses the version determine what run the one thing this will not help part what youre moving from test production data but you want manage structure and not pay for nice but expensive management package really not very difficult ive also found its pretty good way keeping mental track your
597,76,2008-08-03T01:38:02Z,580,1,agree that scripting everything the best way and what advocate work you should script everything from and object creation populating your lookup tables anything you only wont translate especially for changes not much for first deployments and will end requiring tools like what redgate offers
655,91,2008-08-03T11:41:38Z,650,69,with the built stuff you cant using will replace the revision and build numbers with coded datetimestamp which usually also good way for more info see the documentation the tag for automatically incrementing numbers use the assemblyinfo task this can configured automatically increment the build number there are gotchas each the numbers the version string limited this windows limitation and unlikely get fixed using with with subversion requires small change retrieving the version number then quite easy version string about yourapp version vmajor vminor vbuild vrevision and clarify net least the build actually the third number not the fourth one some people for example delphi developers who are used majorminorreleasebuild might expect net its majorminorbuildrevision
787,175,2008-08-03T18:46:33Z,650,4,what source control system are you using almost all them have some form tag that gets expanded when the file checked usually use some form hackery display this the version number the other alternative use use the date the build number
818,233,2008-08-03T20:45:27Z,810,0,partway solution with this entry msdn dont know how couldnt find before usermachine hive subkeys and values entered under this hive will installed under the hkeycurrentuser hive when user chooses just the hkeyusers hive when user chooses everyone during installation registry editor
820,91,2008-08-03T20:48:47Z,810,3,first yes this something that belongs the application for the exact reson you specified what happens after new user profiles are created sure youre using domain its possible have some stuff put the registry creation but this not really use case the application should check there are seetings and use the default settings not that being said possible change other users keys through the hkeyusers hive have experience with the visual studio setup project here bit totally unrelated vbscript code that might just give you idea where look const hkeyusers strcomputer set strcomputer objregenumkey hkeyusers strkeypath arrsubkeysstrkeypath providerssoftware publishingfor each subkey arrsubkeys objregsetdwordvalue hkeyusers subkey strkeypath state next code courtesy jeroen ritmeijer
829,234,2008-08-03T21:17:33Z,810,4,guessing that because you want set for all users that youre some kind shared computer which probably running under domain here dragons lets say joe and jane regularly log onto the computer then they will each have registries youll then install your app and the installer will employ giant hacks and disgusting things set items under hkcu for them then bob will come along and log and other people have accounts the domain and can this hes never used this computer before has registry the first time logs windows creates him one but wont have your setting your app then falls over behaves incorrectly and bob complains loudly about those crappy products from raynixon incorporated the correct answer just have some default settings your app which can write them the registry doesnt find them its general good practice that your app should never depend the registry and should create things needed for any registry entry not just hkcu anyway
870,233,2008-08-03T22:34:06Z,810,0,despite what the msdn article says about usermachine hive doesnt write hkeyusers rather writes hkcu you select just and hklm you select everyone solution going use the usermachine hive and then the application checks the registry entries are hkcu and not copies them from hklm know this probably isnt the most ideal way doing but has the least amount changes

1044,227,2008-08-04T06:01:52Z,1040,32,killing other processes not healthy thing your scenario involves something like uninstallation you could use the mark the file for deletion upon next reboot appears that you really need delete file use another process recommend reconsidering the actual problem before considering any solutions
1049,234,2008-08-04T06:12:11Z,1040,5,you want programatically not sure and really recommend against youre just troubleshooting stuff your own machine can help you run use the find handle command think its either the find handle menu and search for the name your file once the handles found you can forcibly close them you can then delete the file and beware doing this may cause the program which owns the handles behave strangely youve just pulled the proverbial rug out from under but works well when you are debugging your own errant code when visual studio windows explorer being crap and not releasing file handles even though you told them close the file ages ago sigh
1050,234,2008-08-04T06:14:42Z,1040,1,one big hack employed years ago that windows wont let you delete files but does let you move them pseudosortofcode windirsystem mfc dll windirsystem mfc dllold install new mfc dll tell user save work and restart applications when the applications restarted note didnt need reboot the machine they loaded the new mfc dll and all was well that coupled with pendingfileoperations delete the old one the next time the whole system restarted worked pretty well
1074,1,2008-08-04T08:04:41Z,1010,7,rex suspect good place start looking solutions that compress the viewstate theyre grabbing viewstate the server before its sent down the client and gzipping thats exactly where you want
1082,116,2008-08-04T08:21:07Z,1070,2,yes you are right lock the vsz will give you the vsz and rss which are the virtual memory size and resident set size the rss how much physical memory has been allocated the process and the vsz the virtual memory size the process you have several copies program running lot the memory the vsz will shared between those processes
1093,51,2008-08-04T09:04:17Z,1010,2,see this blog post where the author describes method for overriding the default behavior for generating the viewstate and instead shows how save the server session object aspnet viewstate saved descendant pagestatepersister class this class abstract class for saving and loading viewsstate and there are two implemented descendants this class net framework named and default used saveload viewstate information but can easily get the work and save viewstate session object although did not test his code seems show exactly what you want way gain access viewstate code while still the server before postback

1347,17,2008-08-04T15:37:31Z,1300,0,honestly depends what fits your environment better you are using lot nonmicrosoft tools nunit ccnet ncover you will probably find better support with nant alternatively you are using mstest tfsbuild you will probably find msbuild better environment would learn both and use which every fits more smoothly with your environment
1364,35,2008-08-04T15:52:42Z,1300,2,youve already got bunch custom tasks you use with nant stick with you dont gain much with msbuild that said there doesnt seem anything that nant can that msbuild cant its core both can call external tools both can run netbased custom tasks and both have bunch community tasks out there were using msbuild here for the same reason you are its the default build system for now and didnt have any nantspecific stuff worry about the msbuildcommunitytasks are good thirdparty task base start with and covers most the custom stuff ever did nant including vss and subversion support

1446,307,2008-08-04T17:38:59Z,580,2,using smodmo isnt too difficult generate script your schema data little more fun but still doable general take script approach but you might want consider something along these lines distinguish between development and staging such that you can develop with subset data this would create tool simply pull down some production data generate fake data where security concerned for team development each change the database will have coordinated amongst your team members schema and data changes can intermingled but single script should enable given feature once all your features are ready you bundle these single sql file and run that against restore production once your staging has cleared acceptance you run the single sql file again the production machine have used the red gate tools and they are great tools but you cant afford building the tools and working this way isnt too far from the ideal
