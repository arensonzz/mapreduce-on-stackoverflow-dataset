124,26,2008-08-01T16:09:47Z,80,12,wound using this kind hack but actually works pretty well the only thing you have very careful with your semicolons var strsqlstring var inumber var strsqlsplitarray strsqlsplit for strsqlsplitlength
199,50,2008-08-01T19:36:46Z,180,1,ive read somewhere the human eye cant distinguish between less than values apart this something keep mind the following algorithm does not compensate for this not sure this exactly what you want but this one way randomly generate nonrepeating color values beware inconsistent pseudocode ahead colors entered bcolors holds final colors usedrand new randomassumes less than randomgenint while lencolors generate random number between for each color newred randnext newgreen randnext newblue randnext temp newred newgreen newblue only adds new colors the array temp not colors colorsappendtemp one way you could optimize this for better visibility would compare the distance between each new color and all the colors the array for item color itemsq item item item tempsq temp temp temp dist itemsq tempsq dist absdistnumber can your chosen distance apartif dist number and temp not colors colorsappendtemp but this approach would significantly slow down your algorithm another way would scrap the randomness and systematically through every values and add color array the above example
269,91,2008-08-01T23:49:57Z,260,4,yes thought about that but soon figured out that another domainspecificlanguage dsl would bit too much essentially they need interact with gamestate possibly unpredictable ways for example card could have rule when this cards enter play all your undead minions gain attack against flying enemies except when the enemy blessed trading card games are turn based the gamestate manager will fire onstagex events and let the cards modify other cards the gamestate whatever way the card needs try create dsl have implement rather large feature set and possibly constantly update which shifts the maintenance work another part without actually removing thats why wanted stay with real net language essentially able just fire the event and let the card manipulate the gamestate whatever way within the limits the code access security
